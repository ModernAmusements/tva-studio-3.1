Wenn ein Paket beim Versand verloren geht, gestohlen oder besch&auml;digt wird, muss eine Reklamation beim verwendeten Versanddienstleister eingereicht werden und nicht bei tv&aring; studio. Wenn ein Paket anzeigt, dass es &uuml;ber die Sendungsverfolgungsnummer geliefert wurde und der Kunde sein Paket nicht finden kann, ist tv&aring; studio nicht verantwortlich und stellt keine R&uuml;ckerstattung oder Gutschrift aus. Die von jedem Vertrag abgedeckten Produkte (d. H.

Alle R&uuml;cksendekosten gehen zu Lasten des K&auml;ufers. Sollten Sie feststellen, dass Ihr Artikel bei Ihrer Ankunft besch&auml;digt ist, machen Sie bitte ein Foto, das zeigt, wie er Ihnen geliefert wurde, bevor Sie uns schreiben.</p>
    <p>7. Pakete, die abgelehnt oder zur&uuml;ckgesandt werden, unterliegen unserer Wiederauff&uuml;llungsgeb&uuml;hr von 10% pro Artikel.

Die Wiederauff&uuml;llungsgeb&uuml;hr tr&auml;gt zur Bearbeitung von Bestellungen und zum sorgf&auml;ltigen und zeitnahen Kundenservice bei.</p>
